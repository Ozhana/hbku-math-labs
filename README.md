# HBKU Mathematics Computational Labs (Python)

This repository contains Python-based computational lab activities designed to support Precalculus, Calculus I and Calculus II learning through visualization, numerical verification, and problem-solving.

## Topics
- Limits & continuity (visual intuition + numerical checks)
- Derivatives (difference quotients, tangent line approximation, optimization)
- Integration (Riemann sums, numerical integration, accumulation)
- Sequences & series (optional extension)
- Scientific computing examples (applied mathematics / modeling)

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib (and optional: SciPy, SymPy)
