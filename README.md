## Lab topics (folders)

### 1) Limits & Continuity
Path: `labs/limits-continuity/`

Typical activities:
- Visual intuition for limits (removable/jump behavior)
- Numerical limit checks (left/right approaches)
- Continuity testing with graphs + computations

### 2) Derivatives
Path: `labs/derivatives/`

Typical activities:
- Difference quotient approximations
- Tangent line approximation and error behavior
- Optimization using derivatives (numerical + visual)

### 3) Integration
Path: `labs/integration/`

Typical activities:
- Riemann sums (left/right/midpoint)
- Numerical integration (trapezoid/Simpson-style comparisons)
- Accumulation and area interpretation

### 4) Sequences & Series (Extension)
Path: `labs/sequences-series/`

Typical activities:
- Partial sums and convergence behavior
- Taylor series approximation (visual comparison)

### 5) Scientific Computing & Modeling
Path: `labs/scientific-computing-modeling/`

Typical activities:
- Simple ODE modeling (Euler vs RK-style methods)
- Applied numerical simulations (e.g., diffusion/heat-style models)
